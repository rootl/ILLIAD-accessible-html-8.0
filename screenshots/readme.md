Screenshots demonstrating how these ILLiAD/IDS pages display on the SUNY Geneseo Milne Library ILLiAD instance. 

Screenshot filenames starting with "IDS" refer to top level IDS related webpages, located at the top level of this repository. 

Screenshot filenames starting with "ILLIAD-Lending" refer to ILLiAD Lending pages (modified 'out of the box' Atlas Systems ILLiAD web pages), located in the ILLIAD-accessible-html-8.0/Lending/ directory.

The following screenshots have highlighted areas and notes pertaining to the header and menu include files:

The following files diagram the markup changes to ILLiAD and IDS forms, and can serve as a guide for making changes to the forms yourself:
