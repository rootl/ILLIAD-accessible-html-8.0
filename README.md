# ILLIAD-accessible-html-8.0
WCAG Accessibility compliant and responsive public facing web files for ILLiAD and IDS

Remember to back up all your existing web files (ie anything with these extensions: html, shtml, css, inc).

You should be able to rename these files as test or set up a test ILLiAD directory where you can preview look and feel of the pages before you replace them on your live site.

If you want to replace your web files completely with the ones in this repository, you must also add these directories (or add these files to the directories if they already exist):

    \styles\
      Gist4Web.css (required) 
      \fonts\ subdirectory (not required but useful)
    

    \includes\  (all these files are required)
  
      drupalheader_responsive.inc  
      drupalfooter_responsive.inc 
      include_menu.html
      include_menu_you_are_logged_in_as.html
      include_notification_preferences.html
  

    \Lending\   (all these files are required)

  
  
You can also copy the form code from within the html files and replace the code in your html files.
